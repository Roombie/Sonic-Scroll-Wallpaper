# Sonic Diagonal Scroll Wallpaper

A simple animated background using JavaScript and HTML canvas that scrolls a repeating Sonic pattern diagonally.

## How it works

- The background is drawn on a `<canvas>` element.
- An image of Sonic (`SonicScroll.jpeg`) is tiled and smoothly scrolled diagonally.
- Ideal for use in Wallpaper Engine or personal web-based wallpapers.
